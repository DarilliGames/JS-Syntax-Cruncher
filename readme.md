### The Practice Suite / Learning Checkpoint

## About

### *The Practise Suite*

The project is a place for individuals learning JavaScript to practise their sythax with simple challenges.  Unlike other platforms where the challenge is pre-defined and where the number of challenges are limited - this project automatically generates questions.  This means that instead of repeating the same challenge(s) over and over again - a new challenge is presented.

### *Learning Checkpoint*

In addition for allowing users to practice their syntax, the project also contains a score system.  A user can enable a time trial mode for each challenge.  Once enabled, the developer must complete as many challenges within the given time period.  This allows them to have a method for them to track their improvement in understanding the syntax (and/or their typing skills too).  Score are both an integer but if the score falls between a certain range, the user will be given a medal.  The medals allow users to understand how they are doing rather than just a number without context.

- Bronze - User is still learning
- Silver - User has a good understanding
- Gold - User Knows the the sytax and formatting well
- Diamond - A "secret" medal for those with exceptional understanding and typing skills
